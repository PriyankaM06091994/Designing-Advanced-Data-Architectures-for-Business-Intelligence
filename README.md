## Designing-Advanced-Data-Architectures-for-Business-Intelligence

## 1) IMDB Data and Analysis

### Steps:
1)	Designed dimensional model in ER Studio Data Architect
2)	Performed data profiling and loaded data from tsv/csv files into the staging tables using Talend
3)	Used these staging tables to populate the dimensional tables using Talend
4)	Created dashboards and visualizations on Tableau and Power BI for answering business questions and to gain better insights 

### Project Deliverables:
• Ingest initial set of tsv or csv files into staging tables
• Design and load dimensional model for above data
• Perform data consistency & cleansing processes
• Add supplemental data to model
• Design and create BI visualizations answering business questions

## 2) Adventure Works Purchasing DW

### Objectives:
•	Listed all the products purchased by Adventure Works from vendors viz Purchase Orders
•	Listed product attributes like list price, standard cost, model name, subcategory name and category name
•	Applied SCD’s (slowly changing dimension) on list prices, standard costs and employee pay
•	Listed all the dimensions in regards with Adventure Works which includes people, vendors, purchase orders, products etc.
•	Included Geography dimension that Adventure Works could use as outrigger for dimensions above
•	Included calendar dimension that Adventure Works could use for facts and dimensions
•	Included product inventory dimension for purchased products and locations stored in

### Steps:
•	Analyzed data for source/target mappings and performed data profiling on Adventure Works 2017 database
•	Created data model in ER Studio Data Architect and performed DDL operations on the target database
•	Implemented error handling and inserted the bad data into reject tables along with their respective reject codes and reject reasons
•	Performed data cleansing and loaded data into Adventure Works Purchasing DW using Alteryx and Talend
•	Designed visualization reports and interactive dashboards on Power BI and Tableau to gain better insights


## 3) NYPD 

1)	Created Dimensional Data Model using ER studio Data Architect
2)	Generated DDL and created schema in NYPD Database – MySQL
3)	Performed data profiling and cleansing processes
4)	Loaded data into data model from respective CSV’s using Talend
5)	Created visualization reports in Power BI and Tableau using NYPD database

## 4) Chinook Database
1) Converted ER Model to Dimensional Model 
•	Listed facts & dimensions 
•	Made a list of tables to be combined
•	Created date and calendar dimensions. Also applied SCD’s (slowly changing dimension) on these tables
•	Created tables with surrogate SKs, NKs & FKs 
•	Determined table attributes and performed source to target mappings
2) Created data model in ER/Studio Data Architect
3) Generated DDL, created tables and uploaded data in the target database viz SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle11g
4) Created visualization reports and dashboards in Power BI

 ## 5) Sakila Database
1)	Formulated advanced SQL queries on Sakila Database
2)	Created data visualizations on Power BI
